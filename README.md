# Flipside SDK (formerly known as ShroomDK)

Programmatic access to the most reliable & comprehensive blockchain data in Web3.

You've found yourself at the FlipsideCrypto SDK repository, the official SDK to programmatically query all of Flipside Crypto's data.

## 🧩 The Data
Flipside Crypto's Analytics Team has curated dozens of blockchain data sets with more being added each week. All tables available to query in Flipside's [Data Studio](https://flipside.new) can be queried programmatically via our API and library of SDKs.
